**************************************

A .mzm file is a text file which can describe one or more mazezams. The format
is based upon the format for .xsb files which describe Sokoban levels.

Lines in a .mzm file should be one of:
1. a row making up a mazezam -
   contiguous rows are thought to belong to the same mazezam.
2. a blank line - which can be used to separate mazezams.
3. a comment - a line beginning with a ";".
   This will also separate mazezams if put between mazezam rows.

Rows:
=====
Rows are lines consisting of the following characters only:
      # - the outer wall 
(space) - a space
      $ - a block (i.e. part of a row which can be pushed left or right)
      + - the entrance to the mazezam
      * - the exit from the mazezam

Comments:
=========
Any line beginning with a ";" is a comment. Comments beginning ";;" are
thought to contain metadata.

Four types of metadata are specified by version 1 of the .mzm file format.
;;Version: <which mazezam format the following mazezam(s) are in>
;;Title: <title of the following mazezam(s), 28 characters maximum>
;;Author: <author of the following mazezam(s)>
;;Comment: <comment about the following mazezam(s)>


Valid Mazezams:
===============
A valid version 1 mazezam satisfies the following constraints:
1. It must have a rectangular outer wall.
2. Wall pieces must only occur in the outer wall.
3. There is only one entrance, which must be in the left-hand wall.
4. There must be a space directly on the right of the entrance.
5. There is only one exit, which must be in the right-hand wall.

Mazezams Wanted:
================
If you create some mazezams, I'd appreciate it if you would send a .mzm file
to me at tyrrelmr@cs.tcd.ie. Thanks!

N.B. The creator of a mazezam holds copyright on their creation. If you
distribute mazezams created by other people you must check that you have 
permission to do so. If you distribute them in .mzm format, you should leave
the Author tags intact.
