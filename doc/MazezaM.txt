MazezaM - a puzzle game

Introduction:
=============
MazezaM (pronounced "may-zam") is a simple puzzle game. You enter the
mazezam on the left and you have to get to the exit on the right by
pushing rows of blocks left and right. If you get stuck you can
retry the mazezam, but this will cost you a life.

To the best of my knowledge MazezaM's specific game logic is original. 
Unfortunately, there are so many puzzles out there that it is impossible for
me to be sure. If you are aware of a prior instance of the idea, please get
in touch. If possible, include a link which I can add to my web page.

The idea for MazezaM came to me while recalling an Oric-1 type-in game
called "Fall Guy" (from the book "Sixty Programs for the Oric-1" by Robert
Erskine, Humphrey Walwyn, Paul Stanley and Michael Bews). The game play is a
reminiscent of the game Sokoban (Thinking Rabbit, Inc) and also bears a
resemblance to "sliding block" or "sliding piece" puzzles where wooden shapes
are moved around in order to get a (usually larger) shape from one side of the
puzzle to the other. The name "MazezaM" was suggested by Robert Byrne.

Implementations Wanted:
=======================
I encourage you to implement MazezaM for other platforms. If you plan to do
so, I request that you accept the following conditions:
1. If you implement MazezaM as described here, then you should call the puzzle
   game itself "MazezaM". You should call the individual puzzles either
   "mazezams" or some standard name like "levels" --- please do not make up a
   new name for them. You may choose whatever name you want for the 
   implementation, including the name "MazezaM".
2. If you implement an extension to MazezaM (i.e. you create a derivative
   puzzle game), then you should acknowledge the fact that it derives from
   MazezaM.
3. E-mail me at tyrrelmr@cs.tcd.ie so I can put a link on my web page.
4. Remember: if you include mazezams created by other people with your
   implementation, you need to check that you have permission to do so.
